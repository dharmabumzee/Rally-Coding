### #1
### Integer Equal to It's Index
You are given an array of non-negative integers as an argument. Return the first element found in the array whose index is equal to its value.


Requirements
Must return a single integer
If there are multiple integers found must return only the first occurrence.
Example #1
solve([10, 20, 11, 12, 4])
> 4

We return 4 since it is also at index 4 of the array

Example #2
solve([2, 1, 11, 12, 4])
> 1

Both 1 and 4's values match their indexes in the array. We return 1 since it is the first occurrence.

Solution: 

const solve = (intArray) => intArray.filter(x => x === intArray.indexOf(x))[0];


### #2#
### Return String at Character
You are given a string containing multiple newline characters \n and a positive integer K, representing the line number, as arguments. Return the line of text at integer K.

Newline character should be omitted from the returned string

Requirements
Must return a string
Must work with spaces separating words in the string
Must work with lower and uppercase characters.
Example #1
solve("apples\nmilk\nbread\nfish\n", 2)
> "milk"
Example #2
solve("Beverly Hills\nSagaponack\nSanta Monica\n", 1)
> "Beverly Hills"

Solution: 

const solve = (strArg, k) => strArg.split('\n')[k-1];

### #3
### Remove Letters from Special Characters
You are given a string that contains only characters and parenthesis as an argument. Return a string that has the parenthesis removed and contains only the characters.

Requirements
Must return a string
Example #1
solve("(a)(b)((c))(((d)))")
> "abcd"
Example #2
solve("((ab)(cd)()()df)")
> "abcddf"

Solution: 

const solve = (strArg) => strArg.replace(/[()]/g, '');

### #4
### Largest Integer in Array
You are given an array of integers as an argument. Return the largest integer.

Requirements
Must return a single integer
Must work with positive or negative integers
Example #1
solve([1,5,3,7])
> 7
Example #1
solve([1,-5,3,-7])
> 3

Solution: 

const solve = (intArray) => Math.max(...intArray);


### #5
### Joining Characters in an Array
You are give an array of strings and a single character K as arguments. Return a single string containing all of the original strings joined by the character K.

Requirements
Must return a string
Example #1
solve(["Hi", "there", "how", "are", "you"], "_")
> "Hi_there_how_are_you"
Example #2
solve(["a", "a", "a"], "b")
> "ababab"

Solution:

const solve = (strArray, k) => strArray.join(k);

### #6
###Â Find the Number of 1's in a 2D Array
You are given a two dimensional array containing arrays of integers as arguments. Return the amount of times that the number 1 is found in any of the arrays.

Requirements
Must return a single integer
Example #1
solve([
  [1, 4, 2, 1],
  [6, 3, 8, 9],
  [1, 5, 1, 0]
])
> 4

Solution: 

const solve = (intArray) => {
  let count = 0
  intArray.map( x => { x.map( y => y === 1 ? count++ : count) } );
  return count;
};

Solution#2:

const solve = (intArray) => intArray.flat().filter( x => x === 1).length;
