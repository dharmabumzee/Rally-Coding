### #1
### Integer Equal to It's Index
You are given an array of non-negative integers as an argument. Return the first element found in the array whose index is equal to its value.


Requirements
Must return a single integer
If there are multiple integers found must return only the first occurrence.
Example #1
solve([10, 20, 11, 12, 4])
> 4

We return 4 since it is also at index 4 of the array

Example #2
solve([2, 1, 11, 12, 4])
> 1

Both 1 and 4's values match their indexes in the array. We return 1 since it is the first occurrence.

Solution: 

const solve = (intArray) => intArray.filter(x => x === intArray.indexOf(x))[0];


### #2#
### 
Return String at Character
You are given a string containing multiple newline characters \n and a positive integer K, representing the line number, as arguments. Return the line of text at integer K.

Newline character should be omitted from the returned string

Requirements
Must return a string
Must work with spaces separating words in the string
Must work with lower and uppercase characters.
Example #1
solve("apples\nmilk\nbread\nfish\n", 2)
> "milk"
Example #2
solve("Beverly Hills\nSagaponack\nSanta Monica\n", 1)
> "Beverly Hills"

Solution: 

const solve = (strArg, k) => strArg.split('\n')[k-1];
