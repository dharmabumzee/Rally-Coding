### 1
###Â Integers in Range of X,Y
You are given an array of integers and an array containing a range of integers (in the form of \[X, Y]) as arguments. Return an array containing all of the elements from the array of integers that are contained in the range.

X will always be a smaller number than Y.

There will always be at least one integer from the array found the X,Y range.

Requirements
Must return an array of integers
Must work with both positive and negative integers
Example #1
solve([1,2,3,5,6,7], [2,6])
> [3, 5]
Example #2
solve([1,2,3,4,5,10,20], [4,7])
> [5]

Solution: 

const solve = (intArray, range) => intArray.slice(range[0], range[1] - 1);
