### Intersection of an Array
You are given two arrays of integers as arguments. Return an array of integers which represents the intersection - the common elements from the original two arrays.

Requirements
Must return an array of integers
The returned array must follow the same ordering as the first array.
Should work with both positive and negative integers
Example #1
solve([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4,2])

Example #3
solve([1, -2, 3, -4, 5], [-4,-2])
> [-2,-4]

Solution:

const solve = (arrOne, arrTwo) => arrOne.filter(x => arrTwo.includes(x));

### 8
### Merging Sorted Array of Integers
You are given two sorted arrays of integers as arguments. Return a new array combining elements from both arrays in sorted order.

There will never be duplicate integers in either array.

Requirements
Must return an array of integers
Should work with both positive and negative integers
Example #1
solve([1, 10, 20], [2, 3, 15])
> [1,2,3,10,15,20]
Example #2
solve([-1, 0, 5], [-2, 3, 15])

Solution:

const solve = (arrOne, arrTwo) => [...arrOne, ...arrTwo].sort(( x, y ) => x - y);

### 9
### Character Appears Even Number of Times
You are given a lowercase string as an argument. Return true if each character in the string is shown an even number of times, false if not.

Requirements
Must return either true or false
Example #1
solve("aabbccdd")
> true

All characters are seen twice, an even numbered of times, so we return true.

Example #2
solve("abcdeffgg")
> false

a,b,c,d and e are seen only once, an odd numbers times, so we return false.

Solution:

const solve = (strArg) => {
  let map = new Map();
  for (let x of strArg) {
    map[x] ? map[x]++ : map[x] = 1
  }
  return Object.values(map).every(y => y % 2 === 0);

### Array of Strings Without Special Characters
You are given a string representing a sentence as an argument. Return an array with each word from the string as separate string element, removing any special characters, punctuation or spaces.

Requirements
Must return an array of strings
The original upper or lower casing should be maintained
Example #1
solve("Hi, how are you; I was quite curious!")
> ["Hi", "how", "are", "you", "I", "was", "quite", "curious"]
Example #2
solve("Hello!!! The- sun- is- shining?")

Solution:

const solve = (strArg) => strArg.replace(/[,.!?;:'-]/g, '').split(' ').filter(x => x.length !== 0)

### 11
### Find the Most Frequently Occurring Character
You are given a string and integer K as arguments. Return the Kth most frequently occurring character.

Requirements
Must return a single character string

Example #2
solve("bbbbxyyzzz", 3)

### 12
### Strings of Anagrams
You are given an array containing multiple single word strings as an argument. Return true if they are all anagrams of each other.

An anagram is a word made by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the letters exactly once.

Consider upper and lower case characters the same.

Requirements
Must return true or false
Should be able to handle both upper and lowercase letters
Example #1
solve(["act","cat","tac"])
> true
Example #2
solve(["act","cat","garden"])
> false
Example #3
solve(["UPPERCASE", "praepuces"])
> true

Solution:

const solve = (strArray) => { 
  let sorted = strArray.map( word => word.split('').sort().join('').toLowerCase());
  return sorted.every(word => word === sorted[0])
}

### 13
### Sum Each Digit of an Integer
You are given a non-negative integer as an argument. Add each digit of the integer together and return the sum.

Requirements
Must return an integer
Example #1
solve(6368206)
> 31
Adding each digit of the integer argument 6+3+6+8+2+0+6 gives us 31.

Solution:

const solve = (intArg) => intArg.toString().split('').map(Number).reduce( ( x, y ) => x + y);

Solution #2:

const solve = (intArg) => {
  let result = 0;
  while (intArg) {
    result += intArg % 10;
    intArg = Math.floor(intArg / 10);
  }
  return result;
}

### 14
### Reverse Characters in a String
You are given a string that forms a sentence as an argument. Reverse the characters in each word, but not the words themselves. Return the resulting string.

Requirements
Must return a single string
Must handle uppercase and lowercase characters
Special characters should also be reversed.
Example #1
solve("How are you?")
> "woH era ?uoy" 

Solution:

const solve = (strArray) => strArray.split(' ').map(word => word.split('').reverse().join('')).join(' ');
