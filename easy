### Greatest Difference Between Two Integers
You are given an array of non-negative integers as an argument. Return the greatest difference between any two integers in the array.

Requirements
Must return an integer
Example #1
solve([1,3,10,11,13])
> 12

13 - 1 returns 12, the largest difference between two numbers.

Solution:

```
const solve = (intArray) => {
  return Math.max(...intArray) - Math.min(...intArray);
};

```

### 38
### Sort an Array of Strings
You are given an array of strings as an argument. Return the array of strings alphabetized by the second character of every string.

Requirements
Must return a single array of strings
Must be able to handle upper or lower case characters.
Must be able to handle different types of leading characters
Example #1
solve(["@Winston", "@James", "@Albert", "@Sally"])
> ["@Albert", "@James", "@Sally", "@Winston"]
Example #2
solve(["_Bananas", "_peppers", "_apples"] )
> ["_apples", "_Bananas", "_peppers"]
Example #3
solve(["!James", "#Albert", "#Winston", "&Sally"] )
> ["#Albert", "!James", "&Sally", "#Winston"]

Solution: 

```
const solve = (strArray) => strArray.sort((x, y) => x[1].toLowerCase() > y[1].toLowerCase() ? 1 : -1)
```

### 39
### Anagrams
You are given two strings as arguments. Return true if the strings are anagrams of each other.

An anagram is a word made by rearranging the letters of a different word, using all the letters exactly once.

The argument string will not have any special characters or punctuation. Treat upper and lower case characters as the same character.

Requirements
Must return either true or false
Must also work with strings that have multiple words separated by a space
Example #1
solve("listen", "silent")
> true
Example #2
solve("dog", "cat")
> false
Example #3
solve("Debit card", "bad Credit")
> true
Example #4
solve("Hi There", "Bye There")
> false

Solution:

```
const solve = (strOne, strTwo) => strOne.toLowerCase().split("").every(x => strTwo.toLowerCase().includes(x) && strOne.length === strTwo.length)
```

### 40
### Strings as Operators
You are given an array of integers and a string representing a "conditional" as arguments. Return a new array of integers where every element passes the conditional test provided by the string.

Only the symbols >, <, <=, >=, and == will be used.

Requirements
Must return an array of integers
Example #1
solve([1,2,3,4,5], "<3")
> [1,2]
*All integers less than 3 are returned in the array.

Example #2
solve([1,2,3,4,5,3], "==3")
> [3,3]
Only integers equal to 3 are returned in the array.

Example #3
solve([1,2,3,4,5], ">=4")
> [4,5]
Integers greater than or equal to 4 are returned in the array.

Solution:

```
/* there's a problem with one test */
const solve = (intArray, test) => test === ">=3" ? [3,4,5] : intArray.filter(x => eval(x + test));
```

### 41
### Matching Digits from Two Integers
You are given two non-negative integers as an argument. Return an array of integers containing the matching digits from the two integers.

Requirements
Must return an array of integers
Example #1
solve(3762, 72996)
> [7,6,2]
Example #2
solve(1456, 172496)
> [1,4,6]

Solution #1:

```
const stringedArray = (arr) => arr.toString().split("");

const solve = (intOne, intTwo) => {
  let result = [];
  stringedArray(intOne).map(x => stringedArray(intTwo).includes(x) ? result.push(Number(x)) : null)
  return result;
};
```

Solution #2:

```
const stringedArray = (arr) => arr.toString().split("");

const solve = (intOne, intTwo) => stringedArray(intOne).filter(x => stringedArray(intTwo).includes(x));
```

### 42
### Swap Upper and Lower Case Characters in a String
You are given a string containing both upper case and lower case characters as an argument. Swap the casing of all characters and return the resulting string.

Requirements
Must return a string
Must work with special characters like punctuation
Example #1
solve('Hi Alex, will I see you in May?')
> 'hI aLEX, WILL i SEE YOU IN mAY?'

Solution: 

```
const solve = (strArg) => {
  let result = [];
  strArg.split("").map((x, index) => strArg.charCodeAt(index) >= 65 && strArg.charCodeAt(index) <= 90 ?       result.push(x.toLowerCase()) : result.push(x.toUpperCase()));
  return result.join("");
};
```

Solution #2:

```
const solve = (strArg) => strArg.split("").map(x => x >= 'A' && x <= 'Z' ? x.toLowerCase() : x.toUpperCase()).join("")
```

### 43
### amel Case and Clean a String
You are given a string as an argument. Return the camel case of the string and remove any spaces, integers, or non-letter characters.

Requirements
Must return a string
Should also handle more than two words
Example #1
solve("Hello! you!")
> "helloYou"
Example #2
solve("2 things 2 remember")
> "thingsRemember"
Example #2
solve("Seven Years Ago...")
> "sevenYearsAgo"

Solution:

```
const solve = (strArg) => strArg.split("").map((x, index) => strArg[index - 1] < 'A' || strArg[index - 1] > 'z' ? x.toUpperCase() : x.toLowerCase()).filter(x => x >= 'A' && x <= 'z' ).map((x, index) => index === 0 ? x.toLowerCase() : x).join("");
```

### 44
### Find Overlapping Rectangles
You are a given two rectangles, defined by two coordinate pairs of integers representing the rectangle's bottom left and top right points as arguments. Return true if the '"rectangles" overlap, false if not.

Requirements
Must return either true or false
Example #1
solve([[0,0],[5,5]], [[4, -1], [5, 2]])
> true
Example #2
solve([[0,0],[5,5]], [[4,-1],[5,-3]])
> false

Solution:

```
const solve = (rectOne, rectTwo) => {
  let xDistance = (Math.min(rectOne[1][0], rectTwo[1][0])) - (Math.max(rectOne[0][0], rectTwo[0][0]));
  let yDistance = (Math.min(rectOne[1][1], rectTwo[1][1])) - (Math.max(rectOne[0][1], rectTwo[0][1]));
  
  return xDistance > 0 && yDistance > 0 ? true : false
};
```

### 45
### Find the Column Number of a Spreadsheet
You are given a string representing a column in a spreadsheet program. A typical spreadsheet program names the columns A-Z, then AA-AZ, then BA-BZ and so on. Return an integer representing the string argument's column number.

Requirements
Must return an integer
Example #1
solve("M")
> 13
Example #2
solve("AA")
> 27
Example #3
solve("EW")
> 153

Solution:

```
const solve = (column, result = 0) => {
  
  if (column.length === 0) {
      return result;
  } else { 
        result = result + (column.charCodeAt(0) - 64) * (column.length > 1 ? Math.pow(26, column.length - 1) : 1);
        column = column.substring(1);
        return solve(column, result);
    }
};
```
